### 👋 Hi, I'm Ashot Petrosyan

🚀 Senior Software Engineer  
💡 Passionate about performance, scalability, and elegant design

### 🧠 About Me
I believe code should be **simple, readable, and self-explanatory**—no unnecessary complexity. I'm deeply interested in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing EF Core queries, implementing custom database functions, and exploring EF Core internals like interceptors and design-time services.

I also enjoy working with containerized systems and frequently use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-service environments.

Startups are my natural environment—fast-paced, full of unique challenges, and opportunities to wear multiple hats and build impactful solutions.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET Core, EF Core, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Redis, MongoDB  
- **Data/Infra**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, gRPC, Protobuf  
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Material Design, Blazor, MudBlazor  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Apache, Nginx  
- **Authentication**: Duende IdentityServer

### 📚 Areas of Focus

- Scalable system design and high-load architecture patterns  
- Efficient database strategies, caching, and distributed messaging  
- Building robust, production-grade microservices with clean separation and observability  

I'm passionate about contributing to well-structured, modular, and performance-driven systems.  
Currently exploring open-source contributions to tools like **EF Core**, **Npgsql**, and others in the .NET ecosystem. Always open to new challenges and collaboration.
