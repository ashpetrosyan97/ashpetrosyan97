### 👋 Hi, I'm Ashot Petrosyan

🚀 Senior Software Engineer

💡 Minimalist developer focused on performance, scalability, and elegant design

### 🧠 About Me
I believe code should be **simple, readable, and self-explanatory**—no extra fluff. I'm passionate about identifying bottlenecks, diving deep into EF Core, optimizing queries, and implementing custom database functions. I also enjoy containerization, particularly using Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration.

Startups are my natural environment—fast-paced, problem-rich, and full of opportunity to wear multiple hats and solve real problems.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET Core, EF Core, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **Data/Infra**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, gRPC, Protobuf
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Material Design, Blazor, MudBlazor
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Apache, Nginx

### 📚 Areas of Focus
- Scalable system design and high-load architecture patterns
- Efficient database strategies, caching, and distributed messaging
- Building robust, production-grade microservices with clean separation and observability

I'm passionate about contributing to well-structured, modular, and performance-driven systems.
I’m also actively looking to contribute to open-source tools like **EF Core**, **Npgsql**, **etc**, and I'm always open to interesting challenges in the .NET ecosystem.

### 🌱 Personal Goals
My future goal is to launch my own product—already in progress! It’s something I’m building with long-term sustainability in mind.
